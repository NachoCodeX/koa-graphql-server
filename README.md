# Koa-graphQL Template
This project contains  Koa server, GraphQL, Socket.io and MongoDB as database,It follows a OOP(Oriented Object Programming) and Dependecy Injects to take advantages of the benefits of that  programming paradigm, I think that this template is a good structure for writing real time koa applications, not the best but it's good for small projects and I can safely say maybe medium projects, I've tested it  in small project for school, If someone want to use in his or her projects, I would be proud and glad, it uses the following: 
 

> Koa
> 
> Typescript + Dependency Injection
> 
> Socket.io
> 
> graphQL(Apollo)
>
